# Meia-Lua

This respository contains my senior project for Cal Poly, SLO.
It will *eventually* be a type system for the Lua programming language.

## Requirements

* [Antlr4](https://www.antlr.org/index.html) if you intend to change to `Lua.g4` grammar file.

## Roadmap

* Type checking for basic types
* Compilation to standard Lua
* Type descriptions for builtin library functions
* Allow type descriptions for custom types i.e. tables
* A well defined border between typed lua and un-typed lua
