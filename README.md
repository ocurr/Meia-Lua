# Typed Lua

This respository contains my senior project for Cal Poly, SLO.
It will *eventually* be a type system for the Lua programming language.

## Roadmap

* Type checking for basic types
* Compilation to standard Lua
* Type descriptions for builtin library functions
* Allow type descriptions for custom types i.e. tables
* A well defined border between typed lua and un-typed lua
